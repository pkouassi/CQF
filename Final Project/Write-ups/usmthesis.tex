%% Example of loading other packages that you may require.
%% I'm loading the marvosym package so that I can produce a
%% smiley face with the command \Smiley.
\usepackage{marvosym}

%% Also, the enumitem package is great for customising
%% list environments.
\usepackage{enumitem}

%% Listings is a nice package for typesetting code
%% listings. Other possible packages include fancyvrb,
%% minted, etc.
\usepackage{listings}

%% For those who need to produce algorithms and pseudocode.
%% There are a number of different packages available, but
%% unfortunately they tend not to work well together!
%% I'm using algorithmicx, specifically algpseucode, here.
